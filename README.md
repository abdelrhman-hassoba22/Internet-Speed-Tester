# **conection speed**
**This script tests internet connectivity, download speed, and upload speed.**

## **usage:**
Give the script X permission
Then let it run; it will test whether you are connected to the internet and measure the download and upload speeds.

### **notes:**
I use to test download speed file from "testfiles" website if you want to change it.
go to line number '17' And replace the link with the one you want.
You can also do this for the server link used to test the upload speed
replace url 'https://librespeed.org' whit one you want 
just go to line number '28' and change it.
